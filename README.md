# Learning-to-use-the-Godot-Game-Engine
I'm learning to use the Godot Game Engine, through the book ***"Godot Engine Game Development in 24 Hours. The Official Godot 3.0 Guide"***    
>
>Because the principle of this project would be to learn from the oldest versions to the most current (Godot 4.0).
>
>And I chose this book because it was written by Godot's developer tie.
